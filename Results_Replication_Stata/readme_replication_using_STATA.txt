Here I present the codes for replication of regression results 
and figures 1-6 of my M.Sc. Thesis, using R. 
Kindly note that all the results are preliminary, and therefore, should not be shared or cited 
The codes are being shared with limited people now (Private repository). Kindly do not share the codes, 
do not post it on a public domain
Thank You 

The contents of this folder are mentioned below - 
1. PanelData_1991to2019_Varsinpercent - Dataset used for replication of regression results, figures 3-6
2. India_State_Boundary.dbf - used for creating choropleth maps (figures 5-6)
3. India_State_Boundary.shp - Shapefile (.shp file) used for creating choropleth maps (figures 5-6)
4. Indstatedb.dta - generated and used for preparing choropleth maps (figures 5-6)
5. Indstatecoord.dta - generated and used for preparing choropleth maps (figures 5-6)
6. trans_1991.dta - generated and used for preparing choropleth maps (figures 5-6) 
7. trans_2019.dta - generated and used for preparing choropleth maps (figures 5-6)

(statecodes in shp files often do not match statecodes in datasets with attributes, trans_1991 and trans_2019 are created to take care of that mismatch)

8. Data1991_maps_with_extrastatesanduts.dta - generated and used for preparing choropleth maps (figures 5-6) 
9. Data2019_maps_withextrastatesanduts.dta - generated and used for preparing choropleth maps (figures 5-6) 
10. Outcomes_graph_stata.csv - used for creating the plot of average number of schools (figure 1)
11. Reservation_Vars_graph_stata.csv - used for creating the plot of average reservation shares (figure 2) 
12. Replication_PolRes_Stata.do - DO-file with codes for replication of regression results and figures 1-6 of M.Sc. Thesis
13. Outputs_STATA - folder containing all the outputs generated after replication 


.shp file and .dbf files have been downloaded (Source: "https://github.com/AnujTiwari/India-State-and-Country-Shapefile-Updated-Jan-2020")

Replication codes in R-markdown (.rmd) for regression results and figures 1 and 2, are available. Kindly check Results_Replication_R folder for the same.

Thank You
