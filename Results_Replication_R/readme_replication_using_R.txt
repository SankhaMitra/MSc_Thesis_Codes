Here I present the codes for replication of regression results 
and figures 1 and 2 of my M.Sc. Thesis, using R. 
Kindly note that all the results are preliminary, and therefore, should not be shared or cited 
The codes are being shared with limited people now (Private repository). Kindly do not share the codes, 
do not post it on a public domain
Thank You 

The contents of this folder are mentioned below - 
1. Replication_PolRes_R.rmd - R-markdown file containing the codes 
2. Replication_PolRes_R.html - html file with the codes (knitted from .rmd file); displays the figures 1 and 2 as outputs
3. PanelData_1991to2019.dta - Dataset used for replication
4. PanelData_1991to2019_Varsinpercent.dta - Dataset created for replication of results using STATA (very similar to previously mentioned dataset; variables presented as shares in previous dataset have been converted into percentages for better interpretation)
5. Output_R - Folder containing all the output files that would be generated after replication

Replication codes for regression results and figures 1-2 are provided here

Replication codes for choropleth maps (figures 5 and 6) and margin plots (figures 3 and 4) are available for STATA. Kindly check Results_Replication_Stata folder for the same.  

Thank You
