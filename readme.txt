Here I provide the codes for generating the results of my M.Sc. Thesis - "Does Political Reservation in India Lead to Educational Welfare? : An Empirical Analysis of the Relationship Between Extent of Political Reservation and Construction of New Schools"  

Please feel free to replicate them.  
 
The codes are shared in 2 folders - Results_Replication_R and Results_Replication_Stata

Note that codes for all the results are not available in both formats. 
All the results (regression results and figures 1-6) can be generated using STATA.
Codes for generating the regression results and figures 1 and 2, are available in R (R-markdown)

Note that all the results in my thesis are preliminary. Therefore, they are not to be cited. 

Codes are not being made public yet (shared in a private repository). Kindly do not share these with others, do not post these on any public domain.

Thank You
